# APES CIC Universal Agent Instructions

Use this file as the universal `AGENTS.md` operating profile for APES CIC repositories and related website codebases maintained by the Association of Protecting Exotic Species CIC.

This file is written for Codex, VS Code based agents, GitHub Copilot Chat, repository assistants, and similar AI coding agents. It combines the Codex and VS Code workflows into one shared standard.

Agents must load this guidance alongside any local `AGENTS.md`, `INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue, pull request, workspace file, package file, Composer file, build file, configuration file, task file, or task specific instruction.

If local guidance conflicts with this profile, do not weaken APES CIC compliance, issue tracking, branch protection, pull request review, validation, versioning, changelog, Change Log Hub, SEO, sitemap, footer, error page, public folder, local preview, Cloudron LAMP, UK GDPR, safety, or documentation requirements without explicit user approval.

This file is for agent behaviour only. It should not contain private credentials, production secrets, environment values, database passwords, SMTP passwords, OAuth secrets, API keys, or generated credential files.

## 1. Core workflow rule

For APES CIC repositories, use this rule every time:

```text
No issue, no branch, no work on main, no merge without pull request review.
```

Default universal workflow order:

```text
Issue -> Branch -> Open or inspect workspace -> Inspect repository -> Start or reuse local preview -> Plan -> User approval -> Implementation -> Validation -> Diff review -> Commit -> Push or publish branch -> Pull request -> Review -> Merge after approval -> Branch cleanup -> Pull latest main
```

This protects `main`, gives each update a clear audit trail, supports review, and makes work easier to audit, undo, continue, or hand over.

Do not skip a stage unless the user explicitly approves the skip, or the task is clearly trivial and the agent records the safe assumption.

## 2. Supported agent contexts

This guidance applies to:

1. Codex working in a GitHub repository.
2. Codex working in planning mode or implementation mode.
3. VS Code based agents using Source Control, integrated terminal, workspace search, tasks, extensions, browser preview, GitHub integration, or agent chat.
4. GitHub Copilot Chat or similar coding agents working inside a local repository.
5. Repository assistants preparing issues, branch plans, pull request text, release notes, validation summaries, or implementation handoffs.

When a rule is tool specific, follow the relevant tool section. All common safety, branch, issue, validation, Cloudron LAMP, documentation, UK GDPR, and pull request rules apply in every tool.

## 3. Universal operating rules

Before planning or editing, the agent must:

1. Confirm the active repository.
2. Confirm the current branch.
3. Check whether the current branch is protected, shared, production, staging, release, `main`, or `master`.
4. Check for uncommitted changes before making changes.
5. Never overwrite user work.
6. Read relevant repository guidance before editing.
7. Read relevant source files before changing them.
8. Use workspace search, repository search, or file search before editing files.
9. Prefer repository scripts, documented commands, VS Code tasks, and existing tooling over inventing new commands.
10. Keep implementation inside the approved scope.
11. Stop and ask before expanding scope.
12. Provide changed file summaries and validation results before any commit.
13. Never commit private configuration or private data.
14. Never deploy automatically.
15. Never edit `main`, `master`, `production`, `staging`, release branches, or shared long lived branches directly.

If the agent is unsure whether a change is safe, pause and explain the options.

## 4. VS Code specific operating rules

When working in VS Code, the agent must:

1. Confirm the active workspace and repository before planning.
2. Check Source Control before making changes.
3. Use workspace search before editing.
4. Use the integrated terminal only for commands that are needed and safe.
5. Prefer VS Code tasks and documented repository commands where available.
6. Never install VS Code extensions, global tools, packages, dependencies, formatters, linters, or CLIs without approval.
7. Never change VS Code user settings, workspace settings, extension settings, recommended extensions, task files, or launch profiles unless the task requires it and the user approves it.
8. Never pull, reset, rebase, stash, force push, delete files, delete branches, or run database destructive commands without explicit approval.
9. Show the diff, validation results, risks, and recommended next step before state changing Git actions where practical.
10. For website repositories, open the website in the VS Code browser preview, Simple Browser, or approved local view at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` where preview support exists.
11. For website repositories, confirm direct `file:///` access for browser served static pages and public assets, and record any justified server required blocker.

## 5. Codex specific operating rules

When working in Codex, the agent must:

1. Start in planning mode unless the user has explicitly approved implementation.
2. Confirm the current branch before planning.
3. Confirm the related GitHub issue number or recorded issue deferral.
4. Read repository guidance, package files, configuration files, source files, and task relevant files before planning.
5. Identify the website stack, limitations, website type, and hosting target.
6. Start or reuse the local preview server for website repositories before planning implementation or editing files, where preview support exists, using `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` unless repository guidance requires another local HTTP URL.
7. Use the Codex browser or available preview tool to inspect the current site state at the local preview URL where supported.
8. Confirm direct `file:///` access for browser served static pages and public assets, and record any justified server required blocker.
9. Do not edit files until the plan is approved.
10. During implementation, work only on the approved task branch.
11. After implementation, provide a concise handoff with changed files, validation, risks, release record status, GitHub status, and next steps.

## 6. User checkpoints

Ask the user before these state changing actions unless the user already clearly requested or approved the action:

1. Creating or linking a GitHub issue.
2. Creating a branch.
3. Starting implementation.
4. Expanding scope beyond the approved plan.
5. Installing tools, extensions, packages, dependencies, formatters, linters, CLIs, or development servers.
6. Changing workspace, editor, extension, task, launch, or recommended extension settings.
7. Committing changes.
8. Pushing or publishing a branch.
9. Opening a pull request.
10. Marking a pull request ready for review.
11. Merging a pull request.
12. Enabling auto merge.
13. Deleting a remote branch.
14. Pulling latest `main` locally.
15. Deleting a local branch.
16. Closing an issue manually.
17. Running destructive commands such as reset, force push, rebase, stash, file deletion, database migration, database reset, or irreversible cleanup.

If the user has already provided the answer, record it in the plan and do not ask again.

If the user asks the agent to proceed without every answer, use the safest compliant default:

1. Create a new task branch from the default branch.
2. Defer issue tracking only where no issue details exist and record the reason.
3. Produce a plan before implementation.
4. Use a draft pull request when review is still needed.
5. Run repository default validation checks where available.
6. Do not merge or delete branches without explicit approval.
7. Do not install tools or dependencies without approval.
8. Do not change private configuration.

## 7. Required planning prompt

When starting a new GitHub task and the user has not already provided the details, ask one grouped prompt before implementation:

```text
Before I start, please choose:

1. Update type: feature, bug fix, clean up, migration, refactor, documentation, security, compliance, hosting, urgent hotfix, or other.
2. Website type: static website, PHP website, MySQL database website, content management system, custom portal, small web application, migration, merge, documentation only, or other.
3. Issue: create a new GitHub issue, use an existing issue, prepare issue text only, or defer issue tracking with a reason.
4. Branch: create a new branch from main, or provide another new branch name and base branch.
5. Pull request: draft PR, ready for review PR, prepare PR text only, or no PR yet.
6. Scope: files, folders, routes, or areas that are in scope.
7. Non scope: files, folders, routes, or areas that must not be changed.
8. Environment: any Cloudron, MySQL, Redis, email, LDAP, rewrite, private configuration, Windows, Linux, deployment, or local development setting to consider.
9. Local preview server: command to start or reuse before planning implementation or editing files, defaulting to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ where supported, plus file:/// compatibility checks for browser served static files.
10. Validation: repository default checks, named checks, manual checks, browser preview, file:/// static page check, or validation deferred with a reason.
```

After the user answers, produce a plan only. Do not edit files until the user approves the plan.

When creating a new website, merging websites, or migrating an existing website, agents must ask what type of website setup the user wants unless the type is already clear from the user request. The selected website type must control the stack, folder structure, runtime assumptions, routing, validation, documentation, and hosting notes.

## 8. Required planning response

Before editing, the agent must answer with this structure:

```text
Issue:
Branch:
Update type:
Website type:
Hosting target:
Local preview server:
Environment notes:
Files likely to change:
Implementation plan:
Risks:
Validation:
Questions before implementation:
```

The plan must confirm:

1. Current branch.
2. Related issue number or recorded issue deferral.
3. Selected website type or documentation only status.
4. Target hosting where relevant.
5. Local preview URL or blocker.
6. Direct file:/// access status or justified blocker for browser served static files.
7. Private configuration protection.
8. Expected files to change.
9. Checks to run.
10. Documentation, changelog, version, public folder, SEO, sitemap, footer, error page, and release impact where relevant.
11. GitHub issue, branch, pull request, and merge expectations.

## 9. Issue first workflow

Create or link a GitHub issue before starting real work when the task is non trivial, public facing, operationally relevant, compliance relevant, release relevant, hosting relevant, migration relevant, or likely to need an audit trail.

The issue must define:

1. Title.
2. Type.
3. Website type or documentation only status.
4. Reason.
5. Scope.
6. Non scope.
7. Requirements.
8. Acceptance criteria.
9. Testing.
10. Release impact.
11. Hosting impact.
12. Local preview impact.
13. Public folder impact where relevant.
14. Metadata such as labels, milestone, assignees, project, priority, and status where available.

Issue title examples:

```text
Migrate MyAPES Portal to PHP LAMP structure
Fix portal login redirect issue
Create missing privacy and terms pages
Add Cloudron LAMP hosting guidance
```

Issue body template:

```text

```

Creating or drafting an issue is an issue filing action only. Do not treat issue creation as approval to start implementation, create a branch, assign yourself, post a work started update, change issue status, edit files, commit, push, open a pull request, or begin work unless the user explicitly asks for that next action.

When starting from an existing issue, read it before planning and identify missing scope, acceptance criteria, website type, branch expectations, release impact, hosting impact, local preview requirements, validation requirements, metadata alignment, and blockers.

When updating an issue, include a `Files changed` section. List each changed file path with a short note. If no files changed, say so explicitly.

Do not close an issue until it has a completion note covering changed files, validation, release record status, hosting status, local preview status, remaining limitations, and follow up work.

## 10. Branch workflow

Create a branch for every update. Do not work directly on `main`.

All repository updates must be done on a new task specific branch. Do not edit `main`, `master`, `production`, `staging`, release branches, or shared long lived branches directly.

Create the new branch from the approved base branch after repository inspection and after the planning questions have been answered or a safe assumption has been recorded.

Branch naming structure:

```text
type/short-description
```

Preferred branch types:

1. `feature/` for new functionality.
2. `fix/` for bug repairs.
3. `cleanup/` for removing unused files or improving structure.
4. `docs/` for documentation only.
5. `migration/` for larger structural changes.
6. `refactor/` for improving code without changing behaviour.
7. `security/` for security fixes.
8. `hotfix/` for urgent production fixes.
9. `hosting/` for hosting and platform guidance.

Examples:

```text
feature/myapes-portal-login
fix/portal-rewrite-rules
cleanup/remove-old-framework-files
docs/update-agent-guidance
migration/php-lamp-structure
hosting/cloudron-lamp-rules
```

Before creating a branch in VS Code, Codex, GitHub Desktop, or a local clone, check:

1. Current branch.
2. Working tree state.
3. Whether local changes are present.
4. Whether the base branch needs pulling.
5. Whether the requested branch already exists locally or remotely.

Pulling before branching:

1. Ask the user whether to pull latest changes before branching when working in a local clone.
2. Prefer `git pull --ff-only` after checking branch and working tree state.
3. If fast forward pull is not possible, stop and explain options before merge, rebase, stash, reset, or conflict resolution.
4. Never pull over uncommitted user work.
5. Never use hard reset, force push, rebase, or stash unless the user explicitly approves the exact action.

## 11. Local preview standard

For website repositories, always start or reuse the local preview server before planning implementation or editing files where preview support exists.

The required default local HTTP preview URL is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

Agents must open the website at `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in the VS Code browser preview, VS Code Simple Browser, Codex browser, or the available local preview tool before planning implementation or editing files where supported.

Agents must also confirm direct `file:///` access for browser served static pages and public assets. A typical direct file check is:

```text
file:///absolute/path/to/public/index.html
```

Use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` as the primary website preview and validation route. Use `file:///` as an additional compatibility check for static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, downloads, and other public assets.

Do not use `file:///` as a replacement for the local HTTP preview. If a page depends on PHP, server routing, Apache rewrite rules, MySQL, Redis, authenticated sessions, email, form submission, or another server side feature and cannot fully work through `file:///`, record the limitation clearly and continue to validate the server side behaviour through `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.

For APES CIC website repositories using `public/` as the public web root, typical local preview commands may include:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
```

or, where the repository includes a router:

```bash
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public dev/router.php
```

For Node based repositories, use repository documented commands first. Common examples may include:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run build
```

Use repository documented commands first. If no preview command exists, record the blocker before continuing.

Treat local preview as inspection and validation only. It is not deployment evidence.

Before final handoff, inspect changed public pages again through `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` where preview support exists, and repeat the `file:///` check for affected static pages and public assets where applicable.

## 12. Implementation approval gate

Do not implement until the user approves the plan or explicitly says to start implementation.

Approved implementation prompt shape:

```text
The plan is approved with the following constraints:

1. Stay on the current branch.
2. Do not edit main directly.
3. Do not commit private configuration, private data, or generated credential files.
4. Only change files required for this issue.
5. Keep the project compatible with the approved website type, hosting target, and Cloudron LAMP limitations where relevant.
6. Start or reuse the local preview server before implementation work continues, open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported, and record the preview URL or blocker.
7. Check file:/// access for affected browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, and record any justified blocker.
8. After implementation, provide a summary, changed files list, test results, and follow up tasks.

Start implementation now.
```

During implementation, make changes on the task branch only.

If scope changes are required, stop and ask for approval before proceeding.

If the agent becomes blocked, confused, or uncertain, pause and provide:

```text
Pause and summarise:

1. What files have changed so far?
2. What remains to be done?
3. Are there any errors, blockers, or uncertain assumptions?
4. Is the work still inside the issue scope?
5. Is the selected website type and hosting target still being followed?
```

## 13. Diff review before commit

Before any commit, inspect every changed file and ask for review unless the user has clearly authorised automated commits.

Required pre commit summary:

```text
Before committing, here is the review summary:

1. File by file summary of all changes.
2. Files created.
3. Files deleted.
4. Configuration changes.
5. Website type and hosting impact.
6. Possible security concerns.
7. Manual checks recommended.
8. Confirmation that no private configuration or private data is included.

Please confirm whether I should commit these changes.
```

The agent must check:

1. Only expected files changed.
2. Nothing important was deleted.
3. No private configuration or private data is included.
4. Formatting is not broken.
5. Routes and key pages load where validation is possible.
6. Login or portal areas still work where in scope.
7. Privacy, terms, cookies, donation, and Change Log Hub links work where relevant.
8. Local only files are not committed.
9. The selected website type is still followed.
10. Cloudron LAMP assumptions remain valid where applicable.
11. No generated credential files, local database dumps, or temporary debugging files are included.
12. The website has been checked through `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported.
13. Direct `file:///` access has been checked for affected browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or a justified blocker has been recorded.

## 14. Commit rules

Commit only after the diff has been reviewed and relevant validation has been run or intentionally deferred.

Commit message format:

```text
type: short summary
```

Examples:

```text
feature: add portal login structure
fix: correct portal rewrite routing
docs: update agent guidance
cleanup: remove unused framework files
hosting: document Cloudron LAMP limits
```

When preparing a commit message, use this shape:

```text
type: short summary

Body:
1. What changed
2. Why it changed
3. Related issue number
4. Website type or hosting impact where relevant
```

Do not commit if:

1. The branch is wrong.
2. The diff contains unrelated changes.
3. Validation failed and the user has not approved deferral.
4. Private configuration or private data is present.
5. The selected website type is not followed.
6. The user has not approved the commit where approval is required.
7. The work was done on `main`, `master`, `production`, `staging`, a release branch, or a shared long lived branch.

## 15. Push and publish branch rules

After the first clean commit, push or publish the branch only when collaboration, review, CI, or pull request work is needed and the user has requested or approved that workflow.

Do not push or publish a branch unless:

1. The user requested the repository update and push is part of the agreed workflow.
2. The commit is clean.
3. The branch name and base branch are correct.
4. The agent has summarised what will be pushed.
5. Private configuration and private data are not included.

Terminal command shape:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/myapes-portal-login
```

GitHub Desktop route:

```text
1. Select the branch.
2. Click Publish branch.
3. Confirm it appears on GitHub.
```

## 16. Pull request rules

Open a pull request from the task branch into the approved base branch, normally `main`.

Do not open a pull request until:

1. The branch has been published.
2. The diff has been reviewed.
3. Validation has run or the deferral is recorded.
4. The issue is linked or issue deferral is recorded.
5. The website type and hosting impact are recorded where relevant.
6. The user has approved opening a pull request, or the agreed workflow requires it.

Use draft pull requests when implementation is not fully ready for review.

Use ready for review pull requests only when validation is complete or any validation deferral has been intentionally recorded.

Pull request title example:

```text
Feature: add portal login structure
```

Pull request body template:

```text
## Summary

## Risks
List any known risks or say none known.

## Deployment notes

```

Use `Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`, or `Resolves #123` when the pull request should close the issue after merge.

## 17. Pull request review rules

Before merge, review the pull request against the issue, approved scope, selected website type, and approved hosting target.

Universal pull request review prompt:

```text
Review this pull request before merge.

Check:

1. Does the PR fully satisfy the issue?
2. Are there any unrelated changes?
3. Is the selected website type followed?
4. Are there any security risks?
5. Is private configuration protected?
6. Are there any broken routes, links, forms, redirects, or login issues?
7. Are there any Cloudron LAMP compatibility problems?
8. Are there any missing tests or manual checks?
9. Is the PR safe to merge?

Give me:
1. Pass or fail.
2. Required fixes before merge.
3. Recommended improvements.
4. Final merge recommendation.
```

If fixes are required, keep using the same branch and commit fixes to that branch.

Fix prompt:

```text
The pull request review found these issues:

1.
2.
3.

Fix only these issues on the current branch.

Do not introduce unrelated changes.

After fixing, provide:
1. Files changed.
2. What was fixed.
3. Testing completed.
4. Any remaining risks.
```

Then commit and push to the same branch so the pull request updates automatically, after user approval where required.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address pull request review findings"
git push
```

## 18. Validation before merge

Run repository supported checks first. Inspect `package.json`, lockfiles, build scripts, framework configuration, Makefiles, CI files, Composer files, PHP files, dev scripts, and local documentation before choosing commands.

For Node based APES CIC website repositories, common commands may include:

```bash
npm install
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:e2e
npm run build
```

For PHP or Cloudron LAMP compatible repositories, common checks may include:

```bash
php -l path/to/file.php
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public
php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 -t public dev/router.php
```

Minimum manual checks where applicable:

1. Site loads through `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`.
2. The website is opened in the VS Code browser preview, VS Code Simple Browser, Codex browser, or available local preview tool where supported.
3. Direct `file:///` access works for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or a justified server required blocker is recorded.
4. Home page, portal, and key pages load.
5. Registration, login, contact, and other forms work.
6. MySQL queries work where database features are in scope.
7. Email sending still works where email is in scope.
8. Redis cache or sessions work where Redis is included.
9. Rewrites work for public front end and portal routing.
10. Privacy, terms, cookies, donation, and Change Log Hub links work where relevant.
11. Private configuration is protected.
12. Mobile view is usable.
13. Public folder and local preview rules are satisfied.
14. SEO, sitemap, footer, Newsroom, and error page checks are completed where relevant.
15. The selected website type and hosting target are followed.
16. No stack trace, debug dump, private URL, credential, or environment value is exposed.

For documentation only repositories, validation may be limited to Markdown review, link review where links exist, scope review, and secret scanning by inspection.

Treat development server commands such as `npm run dev` or `php -S` as local inspection and validation tools, not deployment evidence.

## 19. Merge rules

Merge only when:

1. The pull request satisfies the issue.
2. Checks pass or deferrals are approved and recorded.
3. The diff has been reviewed.
4. There are no unresolved merge conflicts.
5. Private configuration and private data are protected.
6. The site works locally or in preview where applicable.
7. README, changelog, version, Change Log Hub, generated output, and issue updates are aligned or deferral is approved.
8. Website type and hosting impact are recorded where relevant.
9. The user explicitly approves merge.

For most small or medium APES CIC website updates, prefer squash merge where repository settings allow it, because it keeps `main` tidy.

Do not merge automatically. Do not enable auto merge unless the user explicitly asks.

## 20. Branch cleanup after merge

After merge, ask before deleting branches unless repository settings automatically delete head branches.

Remote branch cleanup:

1. Delete the remote task branch only after the pull request is merged or closed and the user approves deletion.
2. Do not delete a branch linked to an open pull request unless the user explicitly confirms they want to abandon that pull request.
3. If GitHub reports the branch is not merged, stop and explain the risk.

Recommended repository setting:

```text
Settings -> General -> Pull Requests -> Automatically delete head branches
```

Local cleanup after merge:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/myapes-portal-login
```

If Git says the branch is not fully merged, stop and check before forcing deletion.

GitHub Desktop cleanup route:

```text
1. Switch to main.
2. Click Fetch origin.
3. Click Pull origin if available.
4. Use Branch -> Delete only after the PR is merged or safely closed.
```

## 21. Issue closure after merge

If the pull request body used `Closes #123`, `Fixes #123`, or `Resolves #123`, confirm whether GitHub closed the issue automatically after merge.

If the issue is not automatically closed and the work is complete, ask before closing it manually.

Closing comment shape:

```text
Completed in PR #456.

Summary:
1.
2.
3.

The branch has been merged and deleted.
```

Do not close an issue if validation, release records, hosting notes, local preview, or follow up work remain unresolved unless the user approves closure with limitations recorded.

## 22. Full workflow checklist

Agents must track this checklist during GitHub tasks:

```text
1. Create or link GitHub issue.
2. Add scope and acceptance criteria.
3. Confirm website type and hosting target.
4. Confirm repository and current branch.
5. Confirm working tree state.
6. Create branch from main or approved base branch.
7. Start or reuse local preview server before planning implementation or editing files.
8. Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported.
9. Check file:/// access for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or record a justified blocker.
10. Produce planning response.
11. Wait for user approval.
12. Implement on the task branch only.
13. Review file changes and diff.
14. Run validation.
15. Commit locally after approval.
16. Push or publish branch after approval.
17. Open pull request after approval.
18. Link pull request to issue.
19. Run checks and manual testing.
20. Fix review issues on the same branch.
21. Merge pull request only after approval.
22. Delete remote branch after merge where approved.
23. Pull latest main locally where approved.
24. Delete local branch where safe and approved.
25. Confirm issue is closed or update it with remaining work.
```

## 23. Repository documentation, version, and release records

During planning for repository work, verify the repository documentation, version, and release state where files exist:

1. `README.md`.
2. Root `VERSION`.
3. `/public/VERSION`.
4. Root `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. `/public/CHANGELOG.md`.
6. Website Change Log Hub source page or data.
7. Release metadata files or generated output that render footer version text, public release cards, or static snapshots.
8. Hosting and local preview notes.
9. Repository specific documentation, generated output, package metadata, manifest, sitemap, index, configuration, or operational notes affected by the change.

Record the verified release state in the plan, issue update, or working notes:

1. Current version.
2. Beta or stable status.
3. Expected version bump type.
4. Required README updates.
5. Required changelog updates.
6. Required Change Log Hub updates.
7. Required generated output updates.
8. Hosting assumptions.
9. Local preview assumptions.
10. Selected website type.
11. Any mismatch or deferral.

Use APES CIC semantic website versioning:

```text
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCHb
```

Use the `b` suffix while a site is in beta. Stable versions omit it.

Major changes are breaking route, architecture, public journey, data, compliance, platform, hosting, or operational changes.

Minor changes add user visible features, public routes, broad content expansions, shared components, or meaningful workflow additions.

Patch changes are fixes, copy edits, styling polish, metadata corrections, dependency or configuration fixes, hosting clarifications, local preview clarifications, generated output syncs, and small maintenance changes.

Do not update a version without a matching changelog decision and entry.

## 24. APES website public folder and website type rules

For applicable APES CIC website repositories, `public/` is the website folder and public web root.

When creating APES CIC websites, set them up as HTML websites by default unless the user selects another website type. Use `public/index.html`, static HTML, CSS, browser JavaScript, images, downloads, and other public assets served from `public/`, with PHP available where it supports the HTML site through local preview routing, form handling, reusable includes, lightweight server side helpers, search or sitemap helpers, maintenance scripts, or documented support tools.

Do not make PHP the primary website model unless the repository, issue, selected website type, or user explicitly requires a PHP backed feature.

Do not create WordPress style, CMS backed, custom database backed, or persistent runtime applications by default.

All browser served website files must live inside `public/`.

Do not use `content/` as the public web root. Do not scatter website files across the repository root. Do not create nested public folders such as `public/public/`.

For custom portal projects, prefer this structure when approved:

```text
/public
/public/portal
```

The public front end can sit in `/public`, and the portal can sit in `/public/portal`. Apache rewrite rules may serve the portal from a subdomain such as `portal.apes.org.uk` or another approved portal domain.

## 25. Website type rules

When creating, merging, migrating, or refactoring a website, agents must confirm the selected website type and ensure the repository structure, language stack, routes, validation, documentation, and hosting notes comply with that setup.

Agents must not assume that every APES CIC website should be Laravel, WordPress, Node.js, or a full application. Match the implementation to the approved website type.

### Static websites

Good for simple public websites with pages such as:

1. Home.
2. About.
3. Contact.
4. Services.
5. Policies.
6. Terms.
7. Privacy.
8. Donation information.
9. Basic landing pages.

Languages used:

1. HTML.
2. CSS.
3. JavaScript.

This works well for brochure websites, public information websites, campaign pages, simple front ends, and content based public websites.

### PHP websites

Good for custom websites that need server side logic, such as:

1. Contact forms.
2. Login systems.
3. User dashboards.
4. Staff portals.
5. Public registration forms.
6. Admin panels.
7. Resource libraries.
8. Booking request forms.
9. Case tracking portals.
10. Internal tools.

Languages used:

1. PHP.
2. HTML.
3. CSS.
4. JavaScript.
5. SQL for MySQL queries.

This is the main intended use of the Cloudron LAMP app.

### MySQL database websites

The LAMP app includes MySQL access. Cloudron gives each app its own non root MySQL credentials, while the MySQL server itself is shared across Cloudron apps. MySQL credentials are exposed as environment variables and may rotate, so production code must use `getenv()` rather than hard coded credential values.

Good for:

1. User accounts.
2. Registrations.
3. Enquiries.
4. Form submissions.
5. Membership systems.
6. Ticket systems.
7. Basic CRM style tools.
8. Client portals.
9. Content management systems.
10. Animal records only where the approved project includes the required access control and data protection design.

Languages used:

1. PHP.
2. SQL.
3. JavaScript for front end interaction.

### Content management systems

Cloudron LAMP can host PHP based CMS platforms where their server requirements match the LAMP environment.

Examples include:

1. WordPress.
2. Joomla.
3. Drupal.
4. Grav.
5. ClassicPress.
6. ProcessWire.
7. October CMS.
8. Custom PHP CMS systems.

Cloudron has dedicated apps for some platforms. For something like WordPress, the dedicated Cloudron WordPress app may be easier and safer than the generic LAMP app.

### Custom portals

A Cloudron LAMP container is suitable for a custom portal such as:

1. Public front end website.
2. Login area.
3. Client portal.
4. Student portal.
5. Volunteer portal.
6. Staff tools area.
7. Admin dashboard.

For APES CIC style portal projects, this structure is preferred unless repository evidence or user instructions require another structure:

```text
/public
/public/portal
```

The public site can sit in `/public`, and the portal can sit in `/public/portal`, with Apache rewrite rules used to serve a subdomain such as `portal.apes.org.uk` or another approved portal domain.

For MyAPES Portal style projects, the usual LAMP compatible pattern is:

1. Public front end in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Portal area in PHP.
3. MySQL for public registrations.
4. Cloudron LDAP for staff, volunteer, and student login where LDAP is available and approved.
5. Redis for cache, sessions, or rate limiting.
6. Cloudron email variables for sending messages.
7. Apache rewrite rules for clean URLs and subdomains.

### Small web applications

Good examples:

1. Appointment request system.
2. Public registration system.
3. Volunteer application form.
4. Donation tracking interface.
5. Simple support ticket tool.
6. Knowledgebase.
7. Document request portal.
8. Contact centre forms.
9. Internal reporting tool.

For heavier applications, a dedicated app container or custom Cloudron packaged app may be better.

## 26. Cloudron LAMP compatibility rules

A Cloudron LAMP container is suitable for websites that run on:

```text
Linux
Apache
MySQL
PHP
```

Cloudron LAMP works like traditional shared hosting. Website files are served by Apache and PHP. Cloudron also handles DNS, SSL certificates, MySQL, Redis, email integration, backups, restore, updates, and app isolation for the LAMP app.

For APES CIC style projects, the safest Cloudron LAMP stack is:

```text
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
PHP 8.3 or PHP 8.4
MySQL
Redis
Apache .htaccess
```

Use PHP 8.3 or PHP 8.4 unless repository evidence or user approval requires another supported version.

Languages and formats suitable inside a LAMP container:

| Area | Languages and formats |
| --- | --- |
| Front end structure | HTML |
| Styling | CSS |
| Browser interaction | JavaScript |
| Server side logic | PHP |
| Database queries | SQL |
| Apache configuration | `.htaccess` rules |
| Configuration | `.ini`, `.env`, JSON |

Cloudron LAMP is a good fit for:

1. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP websites.
2. Custom PHP portals.
3. MySQL backed public registration systems.
4. Simple dashboards.
5. Contact forms and enquiry handling.
6. CMS websites where the server requirements fit.
7. Internal admin tools.
8. Small to medium web applications.
9. Websites needing SMTP email sending.
10. Websites needing Redis caching or sessions.

Cloudron LAMP is less suitable for:

1. Large Node.js applications.
2. Python Django or Flask applications.
3. Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, or .NET live server applications.
4. WebSocket heavy systems.
5. Heavy background workers.
6. Microservice architecture.
7. Large API platforms.
8. Applications needing root level server control.
9. High traffic transactional systems requiring horizontal scaling.
10. Sensitive case management, safeguarding, HR, finance, client record, or animal welfare record systems unless access control, audit logging, retention, backup, incident response, and UK GDPR controls are explicitly designed and approved.
11. Payment heavy systems, where hosted Stripe or payment provider flows are usually safer.

Tools such as Node.js may still be used locally for building CSS or JavaScript assets, but the deployed Cloudron LAMP app should normally serve the final built files through Apache and PHP.

For apps written in Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, Rust, Java, or similar, the better route is usually a custom Cloudron app package. Cloudron apps are packaged as Docker images and can use platform addons where declared in `CloudronManifest.json`.

Required Cloudron LAMP checks before completion:

1. Browser served files live under `public/`.
2. The entry point is `public/index.html`, or `public/index.php` is justified by a documented PHP feature.
3. The selected website type is recorded.
4. `.htaccess` is present and Apache compatible where required.
5. Clean URLs work through Apache fallback rules or PHP routing.
6. No route requires a persistent Node, Python, Ruby, Go, Java, WebSocket, worker, scheduler, or daemon process unless approved.
7. Database use is PHP compatible and documented.
8. Cloudron environment variables are used for MySQL and email rather than hard coded credentials.
9. Forms, email, uploads, and third party integrations protect private configuration.
10. UK GDPR, consent, retention, security, and audit implications are noted for forms or stored personal data.
11. README, changelog, Change Log Hub, version records, generated output, and issue updates reflect the hosting impact.
12. Local preview remains aligned with Cloudron LAMP assumptions.
13. `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` has been used as the primary local HTTP preview where supported.
14. Direct `file:///` access has been checked for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or a justified server required blocker has been recorded.

## 27. Security, safety, and UK GDPR rules

Do not edit private production configuration or unrelated environment files.

Do not deploy automatically.

Do not commit, push, open pull requests, merge, close issues, rewrite history, force push, reset, rebase, stash, or delete branches unless the user explicitly asks or clearly approves that action.

Before any state changing GitHub or Git action, show the relevant diff, validation result, risk, and recommended next step where practical.

Never overwrite local user work. If uncommitted or unrelated changes exist, stop and explain the safest options.

Do not add temporary tools, dependencies, deployment scripts, extension recommendations, or workspace settings unless the user approves.

Do not remove or weaken mandatory APES CIC requirements unless the user explicitly asks for that specific removal.

Do not store secrets, database passwords, SMTP passwords, OAuth secrets, API keys, private keys, generated credential files, local database dumps, or private configuration in the repository.

For UK GDPR relevant work, identify and record where applicable:

1. Personal data being collected or processed.
2. Lawful basis.
3. Data minimisation.
4. Consent requirements.
5. Privacy notice impact.
6. Retention period.
7. Access control.
8. Audit logging.
9. Deletion and correction rights.
10. Incident response.
11. Security measures.
12. Processor or third party sharing implications.

Sensitive case management, safeguarding, HR, finance, client record, or animal welfare record systems require explicit access control, audit logging, retention, backup, incident response, and UK GDPR design before implementation.

## 28. SEO, sitemap, footer, Newsroom, and error pages

Update SEO and sitemap records whenever public pages are added, removed, renamed, moved, or materially changed.

Check:

1. Page titles.
2. Meta descriptions.
3. Canonical URLs.
4. Open Graph metadata.
5. Structured data.
6. Robots rules.
7. Noindex rules.
8. Navigation.
9. Footer links.
10. Change Log Hub links.
11. Canonical URL consistency.
12. Sitemap entries.

Confirm the APES universal footer remains present, accurate, accessible, and consistent.

Confirm donation, Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and Change Log Hub footer links where relevant.

Confirm APES Newsroom routing for news, updates, announcements, newsletters, footer, navigation, and article related changes.

Verify branded, accessible 404 pages and any supported 403, 500, offline, maintenance, or fallback pages.

Error pages must not expose stack traces, internal system details, private URLs, credentials, environment values, or debugging output.

## 29. Final response requirements

For every APES CIC website or repository task, the final response must state:

1. Progress summary.
2. What changed.
3. Files changed, with each path and a short explanation.
4. Checks run.
5. README, Change Log Hub, root changelog, public changelog, version record, and generated output status.
6. Public folder and local preview status, including whether `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` was started or reused where applicable, whether it was opened in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported, and whether `file:///` access was checked for affected browser served static pages and public assets.
7. Website type status.
8. Cloudron LAMP and hosting status where relevant.
9. GitHub issue status where relevant.
10. SEO, sitemap, footer, Newsroom, and error page status where relevant.
11. Branch name, base branch, commit status, push status, and pull request status.
12. Pull or sync status, including whether the task branch is up to date with the base branch.
13. Options for what the user wants to do about pulling next, such as pull latest into the task branch, update from the base branch, prepare local pull commands, leave the branch unchanged, or stop for review.
14. Next recommended GitHub step.
15. Proposed commit message.

Keep final responses concise, practical, and transparent about outstanding user decisions.

## 30. Best universal starter prompt for new tasks

Use this starter prompt when the user begins a new GitHub task and has not already provided the needed details:

```text
I want to start a new GitHub task using the correct issue, branch, pull request, and cleanup workflow.

Before doing any implementation, ask me:

1. What type of update is this?
Feature, bug fix, clean up, migration, refactor, documentation, security, compliance, hosting, or urgent hotfix.

2. What type of website setup should this use?
Static website, PHP website, MySQL database website, CMS, custom portal, small web application, migration, merge, documentation only, or other.

3. Should a GitHub issue be created or linked?
If yes, ask for the issue title and description, or the existing issue number.

4. What branch should be used?
Recommend a branch name using feature/, fix/, cleanup/, migration/, refactor/, docs/, security/, hotfix/, or hosting/.

5. What is the base branch?
Default to main unless I say otherwise.

6. What files or areas are in scope?

7. What files or areas are out of scope?

8. Are there any environment variables, Cloudron settings, MySQL settings, Redis settings, LDAP settings, email settings, rewrite rules, private configuration, Windows settings, VS Code settings, local development settings, or deployment settings that must be considered?

9. What local preview server command should be used before planning implementation or editing files?
Default to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ where the repository supports website preview, then open the website in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported.

10. Should direct file:/// access be required for browser served static pages and public assets?
Default to yes for static HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, downloads, and public assets. Record a justified blocker where server side routing, PHP, database, sessions, forms, email, Redis, or rewrite rules prevent full file:/// behaviour.

11. What validation should be completed before pull request?

After I answer, produce a plan only.

Start or reuse the local preview server before planning implementation or editing files where preview support exists.
Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported.
Check file:/// access for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or record a justified blocker.
Do not edit files until I approve the plan.
Do not work directly on main.
Do not commit private configuration or generated credential files.
After implementation, prepare a commit summary and pull request description.
```

## 31. Universal planning prompt for agents

Use this prompt inside Codex, VS Code, GitHub Copilot Chat, or similar tools when asking an agent to plan work:

```text
You are working in this APES CIC GitHub repository.

Before editing files, do the following:

1. Confirm the current repository and branch.
2. Confirm the related GitHub issue number or recorded issue deferral.
3. Check the working tree for uncommitted changes.
4. Read README.md, AGENTS.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, package files, Composer files, configuration files, build files, and relevant source files.
5. Identify the website stack and limitations.
6. Identify the website type: static website, PHP website, MySQL database website, CMS, custom portal, small web application, migration, merge, documentation only, or other.
7. Confirm whether this is a feature, bug fix, clean up, migration, refactor, documentation, security, compliance, hosting, or hotfix update.
8. Confirm whether the target hosting is Cloudron LAMP or another platform.
9. Start or reuse the local preview server for website repositories before planning implementation or editing files where preview support exists. Use http://127.0.0.1:8080/ unless repository instructions require another local HTTP URL. Open the website in the VS Code browser preview, VS Code Simple Browser, Codex browser, or available local preview tool where supported. If the server cannot be started, stop and record the blocker.
10. Check direct file:/// access for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable. If server side routing, PHP, database features, sessions, forms, email, Redis, rewrite rules, or browser security restrictions prevent full file:/// behaviour, record the justified blocker.
11. Produce an implementation plan.
12. List the files you expect to change.
13. List any risks.
14. List validation steps.
15. Do not edit files until the plan is approved.

Answer with:

Issue:
Branch:
Update type:
Website type:
Hosting target:
Local preview server:
Environment notes:
Files likely to change:
Implementation plan:

Questions before implementation:
```

## 32. Universal implementation approval prompt

Use this prompt when approving an agent to move from planning into implementation:

```text
The plan is approved with the following constraints:

1. Stay on the current task branch.
2. Do not edit main directly.
3. Do not commit private configuration, private data, generated credential files, local database dumps, or secrets.
4. Only change files required for this issue.
5. Keep the project compatible with the approved website type, approved hosting target, and Cloudron LAMP limitations where relevant.
6. Start or reuse the local preview server before implementation work continues, open http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported, and record the preview URL or blocker.
7. Check file:/// access for affected browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, and record any justified blocker.
8. Do not install tools, dependencies, packages, extensions, formatters, linters, or CLIs without approval.
9. Do not change workspace, editor, task, launch, or extension settings without approval.
10. After implementation, provide a summary, changed files list, validation results, risks, release record status, GitHub status, and follow up tasks.

Start implementation now.
```

## 33. Universal pre commit review prompt

Use this prompt before any commit:

```text
Before committing, provide:

1. File by file summary of all changes.
2. Files created.
3. Files deleted.
4. Configuration changes.
5. Website type and hosting impact.
6. Security concerns.
7. UK GDPR concerns where relevant.
8. Validation completed, including http://127.0.0.1:8080/ local browser view status where supported.
9. file:/// static page and public asset access status where applicable, or justified blocker.
10. Manual checks recommended.
11. Confirmation that no private configuration, private data, local database dump, generated credential file, or secret is included.
12. Proposed commit message.

Do not commit until I confirm.
```

## 34. Universal pull request review prompt

Use this prompt before merge:

```text
Review this pull request before merge.

Check:

1. Does the pull request fully satisfy the issue?
2. Are there any unrelated changes?
3. Is the selected website type followed?
4. Are there any security risks?
5. Is private configuration protected?
6. Are there any UK GDPR issues?
7. Are there any broken routes, links, forms, redirects, or login issues?
8. Are there any Cloudron LAMP compatibility problems?
9. Are README, changelog, Change Log Hub, version records, generated output, and issue updates aligned?
10. Are SEO, sitemap, footer, Newsroom, and error page requirements satisfied where relevant?
11. Was http://127.0.0.1:8080/ opened in the VS Code or Codex local browser view where supported?
12. Was file:/// access checked for browser served static pages and public assets where applicable, or was a justified blocker recorded?
13. Are there any missing tests or manual checks?
14. Is the pull request safe to merge?

Give me:
1. Pass or fail.
2. Required fixes before merge.
3. Recommended improvements.
4. Final merge recommendation.
```

## 35. Reference topics for agents

When repository guidance is unclear, agents may use official documentation for clarification, but repository instructions and user approved scope take priority.

Useful reference topics:

1. Creating GitHub issues.
2. Creating and deleting branches.
3. Managing branches in VS Code and GitHub Desktop.
4. Creating, linking, reviewing, and merging pull requests.
5. Using closing keywords such as `Closes`, `Fixes`, and `Resolves`.
6. Managing protected branch rules.
7. OpenAI Codex and GitHub connection guidance.
8. GitHub Copilot Chat repository workflows.
9. Cloudron LAMP package documentation.
10. Cloudron custom app packaging documentation.
11. PHP local development with the built in server.
12. UK GDPR and privacy notice requirements.
